=Ctrl-S= saves the file, and =Ctrl-Q= quits the program.  Arrow keys
move the editing cursor, and =PgUp= / =PgDn= move the page up and
down.

** How does it work

Uses a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table][Piece table]] to manage text changes.  See [[../doc/journal/27-text-editor.org][Journal section 27]] for
some details.
