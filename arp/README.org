* Address Resolution Protocol program

This is a program that demonstrates how to send and receive [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol][Address
Resolution Protocol (ARP)]] packets through a network card (assumed to
be at =/dev/nic=), to look up hardware (MAC) addresses from IP
addresses. More details are given in the [[../doc/journal/16-arp.org][journal section 16]].

*Note* This is a simple implementation that is not suitable for actual use:
It assumes that it's the only process using the network card, for example.
The the =tcp= program implements a much more complete TCP stack by using
the smoltcp]] crate.
