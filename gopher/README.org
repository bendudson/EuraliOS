#+end_src

This is a user program which opens [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)][gopher]] pages. When started it loads
the front page of =gopher.floodgap.com=.

** How to use

Running the =gopher= program should bring up a screen like this:

#+CAPTION: The Floodgap gopher server landing page
#+NAME: fig-gopher
[[./floodgap.png]]

Type =h= or =?= to print the "help". Actually pressing any key
which doesn't have a function will print this help.

Navigation is with either WASD or IJKL keys:
- =w= or =i= scroll up the page
- =s= or =k= scroll down the page

Links are numbered on the left and marked a DIR (directory) containing
further gopher links, or a TXT (text) file. Other target types are not
currently recognised.

To follow a link type the number on the left margin.
A "Link: " line should be printed at the bottom of the screen,
listing the address. Press =Enter= to confirm.

To go back press =a= or =j= keys, and to go forward again press =d= or
=l= keys.

Finally, press =q= to quit.

Enjoy!

** How does it work?

This program reads data using the =tcp= device:
#+begin_src shell
  /tcp/hostname/port
#+end_src
