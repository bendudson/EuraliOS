* Creating a RAMdisk

One of the most important functions of an operating system
is keeping track of users' important (and not so important)
data, and providing ways to access and modify it. Usually
this is done by organising data into files in a hierarchical
directory structure. We've made a start on a Virtual File System
(VFS) with OPEN, READ and WRITE messages, but not used them
for actual files yet. To make sure that the system we end up with
isn't tied to a specific filesystem we're first going to get
something working with data stored in memory. Later we'll need
to worry about block storage devices and all that.
