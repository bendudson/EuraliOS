* Porting a text editor to EuraliOS

EuraliOS really needs a simple text editor, to be able to start
doing useful things and changing the configuration from within
the operating system itself. Rather than writing one, we'll try
porting an existing editor.

Ultimately it would probably be best to support a library like
[[https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm][Crossterm]] or [[https://github.com/redox-os/termion][Termion]] (used in Redox OS), that many programs
can use to provide a terminal interface. For now we'll just support
enough terminal escape sequences to run [[https://github.com/ilai-deutel/kibi][the Kibi text editor]].
