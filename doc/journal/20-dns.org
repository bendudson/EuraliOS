* Domain Name System (DNS)

So far our gopher client is hard-wired to the host
IP address 192.80.49.99 (=gopher.floodgap.com=) because
we can't look up names to find other IP addresses.


DNS sockets were [[https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp/commit/da1a2b2df0eafebb7fb92c00e56e88d533daa446][recently added to smoltcp]] but are not yet in
a released version
