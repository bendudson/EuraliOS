* Return to sender

The traditional next step might be to implement a mass storage driver
to allow the OS to read and write to disk. Instead we're going to
work on bringing the network device up in the [[./14-network.org][next section]].

** Starting a driver

In the [[./14-network.org][next section]] we're going to work on a driver for a network
card, the [[https://wiki.osdev.org/RTL8139][RTL8139]]. We'll start this here by writing the code to
request information on PCI devices from the =pci= process.

Create a new crate:
#+begin_src shell
  cargo new rtl8139
#+end_src
then modify =Cargo.toml= (in the root and =rtl8139= directories), the
root =makefile=, add =build.rs= and a basic =rtl8139/src/main.rs= file
as done for =pci= in the [[./12-devices.org][last section]]. Compiling everything (=make run=) should
produce a =user/rtl8139= executable.

** Finding PCI in a Virtual File System

We want this =rtl8139= driver to be able to send messages to the =pci=
program.  One way to do this would be for the kernel to add a
rendezvous handle, but this would be a custom solution and is a good
excuse to start developing something more general: A Virtual File
System (VFS).

A virtual file system organises resources into a hierarchical
structure, with nested directories containing 'files'. These may
correspond to real directories and files on disk, or they may
represent devices or other information, for example the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs][Proc
filesystem]] provides access to information on running processes, with a
'directory' for each process.

Operating systems vary in how virtual file systems are presented to
user programs. In Unix-like operating systems such as Linux almost all
programs see the same file system, but not always: the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot][chroot]] command
and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail][FreeBSD jails]] provide ways to run programs which see a different
view of the file system. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs][Plan 9]] took this further and allows every
program to have a different view of the filesystem.

In EuraliOS the kernel "Merrywig" is going to be quite lazy, and let
user programs do most of the work of creating the VFS. The kernel is
just going to keep a list of "mount points", and use that to direct
program requests to list directories or open files. We'll keep the
option of either sharing VFS between processes or creating a separate
one for each process, by giving each =Process= a =Arc<RwLock<>>= to
contain a potentially shared =Vec= of pairs of =String= (mount path)
and =Arc<RwLock<Rendezvous>>= objects. In =kernel/src/process.rs=:
#+begin_src rust
  struct Process {
      page_table_physaddr: u64,
      handles: Vec<Option<Arc<RwLock<Rendezvous>>>>,
      mounts: Arc<RwLock<Vec<(String, Arc<RwLock<Rendezvous>>)>>> // New
  }
#+end_src

Kernel threads (probably?) don't need mounts, so in =new_kernel_thread()=
we just need to add:
#+begin_src rust
  mounts: Arc::new(RwLock::new(Vec::new()))
#+end_src

User programs need a new parameter:
#+begin_src rust
  pub struct Params {
      pub handles: Vec<Arc<RwLock<Rendezvous>>>,
      pub io_privileges: bool,
      pub mounts: Arc<RwLock<Vec<(String, Arc<RwLock<Rendezvous>>)>>> // New
  }
#+end_src
which is moved into the =Process=:
#+begin_src rust
  process: Arc::new(RwLock::new(Process {
      ...
      mounts: params.mounts, // New
  })),
#+end_src

In =kernel/src/main.rs= the =kernel_thread_main()= function can
now be modified to launch both =pci= and =rtl8139= processes. We
need to set up the inputs so that (for now) both the keyboard
and the mount point are connected to the same Rendezvous (=pci_input=):
#+begin_src rust
  let pci_input = interrupts::keyboard_rendezvous();
  let vga_rz = vga_buffer::start_listener();

  process::new_user_thread(
      include_bytes!("../../user/pci"),
      process::Params{
          handles: Vec::from([
              pci_input.clone(),
              vga_rz.clone()
          ]),
          io_privileges: true,
          mounts: Arc::new(RwLock::new(Vec::new()))
      });

  process::new_user_thread(
      include_bytes!("../../user/rtl8139"),
      process::Params{
          handles: Vec::from([
              // New input (not shared with anything else)
              Arc::new(RwLock::new(Rendezvous::Empty)),
              // VGA output
              vga_rz
          ]),
          io_privileges: true,
          mounts: Arc::new(RwLock::new(Vec::from([
              // A VFS path to the PCI input
              (String::from("/pci"), pci_input)
          ])))
      });
#+end_src


** Open system call

The =sys_open= syscall will (for now) just send a string, as
=write_str()= in =euralios_std/src/debug.rs= does. In =euralios_std/src/syscalls.rs=
we can add an =open= function which is very similar to =write_str()=
but puts syscall number 6 in =rax=, and gets an error code
and handle as return arguments:
#+begin_src rust
/// Returns a handle on success, or an error code
pub fn open(path: &str) -> Result<u32, u64> {
    let error: u64;
    let handle: u32;
    unsafe {
        asm!("mov rax, 6", // syscall function
             "syscall",
             in("rdi") path.as_ptr(), // First argument
             in("rsi") path.len(), // Second argument
             out("rax") error,
             lateout("rdi") handle,
             out("rcx") _,
             out("r11") _);
    }
    if error == 0 {
        Ok(handle)
    } else {
        Err(error)
    }
}
#+end_src

This new syscall will be handled in =kernel/src/syscalls.rs=.
The =dispatch_syscall()= function needs to match syscall 6:
#+begin_src rust
  6 => sys_open(context_ptr, arg1 as *const u8, arg2 as usize),
#+end_src

The =sys_open()= function starts almost the same as =sys_write()=
except we've added some error code returns in =rax=:
#+begin_src rust
  const SYSCALL_ERROR_PARAM: usize = 5; // Invalid parameter
  const SYSCALL_ERROR_UTF8: usize = 6; // UTF8 conversion error

  fn sys_open(
      context_ptr: *mut Context,
      ptr: *const u8,
      len: usize) {

      let context = unsafe {&mut (*context_ptr)};

      // Check input length
      if len == 0 {
          context.rax = SYSCALL_ERROR_PARAM;
          return;
      }
      // Convert raw pointer to a slice
      let u8_slice = unsafe {slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, len)};

      if let Ok(path_string) = str::from_utf8(u8_slice) {
          // Open path
      } else {
          // Bad utf8 conversion
          context.rax = SYSCALL_ERROR_UTF8;
      }
  }
#+end_src

To open the path and get the handle we're going to call a function
in the =process= module, =open_path()=. That function will either
return a handle, or an error code:
#+begin_src rust
  match process::open_path(context, &path_string) {
      Ok(handle) => {
          context.rax = 0; // No error
          context.rdi = handle; // Return handle
      }
      Err(error_code) => {
          context.rax = error_code;
      }
  }
#+end_src

In =kernel/src/process.rs= the =open_path()= function will do the work
of resolving paths to resources. We need to get references to the thread and process structs:
#+begin_src rust
  pub fn open_path(
      current_context: &mut Context,
      path: &str) -> Result<usize, usize> {

      if let Some(current_thread) = CURRENT_THREAD.read().as_ref() {
          println!("Thread {} opening {}", current_thread.tid, path);

          let mut process = current_thread.process.write();

          // Lookup path, add to handles
      }
      Err(0)
  }
#+end_src
Then lookup the Rendezvous corresponding to the path. In future this
will be more involved but for now it will just do a simple text match,
and we'll make it more useful in future sections.
#+begin_src rust
  let option_rv = if let Some((_mount, rv)) =
      process.mounts.read().iter().find(
          |&(mount, _rv)| mount == path) {
          Some(rv.clone())
      } else {
          None
      };
#+end_src
And if a Rendezvous was found, add it to the Vec of handles:
#+begin_src rust
  if let Some(rv) = option_rv {
      let handle = process.add_handle(rv.clone());
      return Ok(handle);
  } else {
      return Err(syscalls::SYSCALL_ERROR_NOTFOUND);
  }
#+end_src
Where we've added a method =Process::add_handle=:
#+begin_src rust
impl Process {
    fn add_handle(&mut self, rv: Arc<RwLock<Rendezvous>>) -> usize {
        // Find if there is an empty handles slot
        if let Some(index) = self.handles.iter().position(
            |handle| handle.is_none()) {
            self.handles[index] = Some(rv);
            return index;
        }
        // No free slot -> Add one
        self.handles.push(Some(rv));
        self.handles.len() - 1
    }
}
#+end_src

To try this out, in =rtl8139/src/main.rs= we can try
opening the "/pci" path to get a handle, then sending
a character message:
#+begin_src rust
#[no_mangle]
fn main() {
    debug_println!("rtl8139");

    let handle = syscalls::open("/pci").expect("Couldn't open");
    debug_println!("{}", handle);

    syscalls::send(handle,
                   syscalls::Message::Short(
                       0, 'X' as u64, 0));
}
#+end_src
This produces the result in figure [[fig-open]], showing character '88' is
received (ASCII 'X').

#+CAPTION: rtl8139 opening a connection to pci and sending a character message
#+NAME: fig-open
[[./img/13-01-open.png]]

** Rendezvous blocking

If several threads (A, B and C) are sharing a Rendezvous, such as the
=/pci= mount point, we could have the following situation:
- Thread A receives, waits for a message;
- Thread B sends, passes to thread A as intended
- Thread C is scheduled and sends a message intended for thread A
- Thread B now runs, calls receive and gets the message sent by thread
  C rather than the reply from thread A.

To prevent this we need to block the Rendezvous, so that only the recipient
can send the reply. First we'll modify =Rendezvous= in =kernel/src/rendezvous.rs=
and make three changes:

1. Modify the =Receiving= state so that it can be restricted to only
   receiving from one thread.
2. Add a new state, =SendReceiving= which represents a thread sending
   a message and expecting a reply back from the same thread that receives
   the message.
3. Add a =send_receive= method which puts a =Rendezvous= into the
   =SendReceive= state.

The =Rendezvous= enum type becomes:
#+begin_src rust
  pub enum Rendezvous {
      Empty,
      Sending(Option<Box<Thread>>, Message),
      Receiving(Box<Thread>, Option<u64>), // Added optional thread ID
      SendReceiving(Box<Thread>, Message), // New
   }
#+end_src
so now the =Receiving= state can optionally block all messages except
those from a specified thread. The =SendReceiving= state differs
from =Sending= because it needs to have a thread to return a message
to, so =Box<Thread>= is not optional.

The functions =send=, =receive=, and =send_receive= (which we're going to add soon)
handle transitions between states. In =send()= the =Receiving= case needs to now
include a check of the thread ID:
#+begin_src rust
  Rendezvous::Receiving(_, some_tid) => {
      if let Some(tid) = some_tid {
          // Restricted to a single thread
          if let Some(t) = &thread {
              if t.tid() != *tid {
                  // Wrong thread ID
                  t.return_error(syscalls::SYSCALL_ERROR_RECV_BLOCKING);
                  return (thread, None);
              }
          } else {
              // No sender thread => error
              return (thread, None);
          }
      }
      ...
#+end_src
We also need to handle the case that =send()= is called on a
=Rendezvous= in the =SendReceiving= state. This just signals
an error because there can't be two threads sending:
#+begin_src rust
  Rendezvous::SendReceiving(_, _) => {
      if let Some(t) = &thread {
          t.return_error(syscalls::SYSCALL_ERROR_SEND_BLOCKING);
      }
      (thread, None)
  }
#+end_src

In the =receive()= method the =Empty= case is slightly
modified, just adding a =None= argument to indicate that
messages from any thread can be received:
#+begin_src rust
  Rendezvous::Empty => {
      *self = Rendezvous::Receiving(thread, None); // Added 'None'
      (None, None)
  }
#+end_src
The =SendReceiving= case is more interesting: We are receiving a
message from a thread which expects a reply from the receiving
thread. We therefore move the sending =Thread= object from the
=SendReceiving= state into a =Receiving= state, along with the ID of
the receiving thread:
#+begin_src rust
  Rendezvous::SendReceiving(_, _) => {
      // Sending, expecting a reply from the same thread
      if let Rendezvous::SendReceiving(snd_thread, message) = mem::replace(self, Rendezvous::Empty) {
          thread.return_message(message);
          // Wait for a reply from the receiving thread
          *self = Rendezvous::Receiving(snd_thread, Some(thread.tid()));
          return (Some(thread), None);
      }
      (None, None)
  }
#+end_src

The =send_receive()= function can now be defined as:
#+begin_src rust
  pub fn send_receive(&mut self, thread: Box<Thread>, message: Message)
                      -> (Option<Box<Thread>>, Option<Box<Thread>>) {
      match &*self {
          Rendezvous::Empty => {
              ,*self = Rendezvous::SendReceiving(thread, message);
              (None, None)
          }
          Rendezvous::Sending(_, _) => {
              // Signal error to thread: Can't have two sending threads
              thread.return_error(syscalls::SYSCALL_ERROR_SEND_BLOCKING);
              (Some(thread), None)
          }
          Rendezvous::Receiving(_, some_tid) => {
              if let Some(tid) = some_tid {
                  // Restricted to a single thread
                  if thread.tid() != *tid {
                      // Wrong thread ID
                      thread.return_error(syscalls::SYSCALL_ERROR_RECV_BLOCKING);
                      return (Some(thread), None);
                  }
              }

              // Complete the message transfer
              if let Rendezvous::Receiving(rec_thread, _) = mem::replace(self, Rendezvous::Empty) {
                  rec_thread.return_message(message);

                  // Calling thread waits for a reply
                  *self = Rendezvous::Receiving(thread, Some(rec_thread.tid()));

                  return (Some(rec_thread), None);
              }
              (None, None) // This should never be reached
          }
          Rendezvous::SendReceiving(_, _) => {
              // Signal error to thread: Can't have two sending threads
              thread.return_error(syscalls::SYSCALL_ERROR_SEND_BLOCKING);
              (Some(thread), None)
          }
      }
  }
#+end_src

** Send-Receive system call

In =kernel/src/syscalls.rs= the Send-Receive system call can be implemented
by much of the same code as =sys_send()=. We can
handle both by passing both in =dispatch_syscall()=:
#+begin_src rust
  4 => sys_send(context_ptr, syscall_id, arg1, arg2, arg3), // sys_send
  5 => sys_send(context_ptr, syscall_id, arg1, arg2, arg3), // sys_sendreceive
#+end_src
then in =sys_send= we can again check the value of =syscall_id=:
#+begin_src rust
  let (thread1, thread2) = match syscall_id & 0xFF {
      5 => rdv.write().send(
          Some(thread),
          message),
      6 => rdv.write().send_receive(
          thread,
          message),
      _ => panic!("Internal error")
  };
#+end_src

** Standard library implementation

In the standard library =euralios_std/src/syscalls.rs= we can simplify
the =send=, =receive= and =send_receive= functions by defining methods
to convert =Message= objects to and from register values. For now
these still only handle =Short= messages. In =euralios_std/src/message.rs=:
#+begin_src rust
  impl Message {
      pub fn to_values(&self)
                   -> Result<(u64, u64, u64, u64), u64> {
          match self {
              Message::Short(data1, data2, data3) => {
                  Ok((0, *data1, *data2, *data3))
              },
              _ => Err(0)
          }
      }
      pub fn from_values(_ctrl: u64,
                     data1: u64, data2: u64, data3: u64)
                     -> Message {
          Message::Short(data1, data2, data3)
      }
  }
#+end_src
The new =send_receive()= function can then be implemented as:
#+begin_src rust
pub fn send_receive(
    handle: u32,
    message: Message
) -> Result<Message, u64> {

    // Convert the message to register values
    let (ctrl, data1, data2, data3) = message.to_values()?;

    // Values to be received
    let err: u64;
    let (ret_ctrl, ret_data1, ret_data2, ret_data3): (u64, u64, u64, u64);
    unsafe {
        asm!("syscall",
             in("rax") 5 | ctrl | ((handle as u64) << 32),
             in("rdi") data1,
             in("rsi") data2,
             in("rdx") data3,
             lateout("rax") ret_ctrl,
             lateout("rdi") ret_data1,
             lateout("rsi") ret_data2,
             lateout("rdx") ret_data3,
             out("rcx") _,
             out("r11") _);
    }
    let err = ret_ctrl & 0xFF;
    if err == 0 {
        return Ok(Message::from_values(ret_ctrl,
                                       ret_data1, ret_data2, ret_data3));
    }
    Err(err)
}
#+end_src

** Using Send-Receive

In the =rtl8139= program we can now try using =send_receive()= to find
a device using the =pci= program. First we open the "/pci" path, then
send a message requesting a device with vendor =0x10EC= and device ID
=0x8139= which is the [[https://wiki.osdev.org/RTL8139][RTL8139 network chip]].
#+begin_src rust
  let handle = syscalls::open("/pci").expect("Couldn't open pci");

  let reply = syscalls::send_receive(
      handle,
      syscalls::Message::Short(
          pci::FIND_DEVICE, 0x10EC, 0x8139)).unwrap();
#+end_src

The reply could be an address (=ADDRESS=, 257) if it was
found, a not-found message (=NOTFOUND=, 258), or something
else:
#+begin_src rust
  let address = match reply {
      syscalls::Message::Short(pci::ADDRESS,
                               address, _) => {
          debug_println!("rtl8139 found at address: {:08X}", address);
          address
      }
      syscalls::Message::Short(pci::NOTFOUND,
                               _, _) => {
          debug_println!("rtl8139 not found");
          return;
      }
      _ => {
          debug_println!("rtl8139 unexpected reply: {:?}", reply);
          return;
      }
  };
#+end_src

Note that we should also handle the case that the =Rendezvous= is
blocked, in which case =send_receive()= will return an =Err= and we
should probably wait and try again.

** Changing network card

The default network card on QEMU is not an =RTL8139= so the =rtl8139=
driver won't get a PCI address. To configure [[https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Networking][QEMU's networking]] to
emulate an =RTL8139= network card we need to add args in =kernel/Cargo.toml=:
#+begin_src toml
  [package.metadata.bootimage]
  run-args = ["-nic", "user,model=rtl8139"]  # New
#+end_src

Running this should produce something like the output in [[fig-address]]
below:

#+CAPTION: rtl8139 using pci program to find device address
#+NAME: fig-address
[[./img/13-02-address.png]]

Now that we have the address of the RTL8139 device, we can start to develop
the driver for it in the [[./14-network.org][next section]].
