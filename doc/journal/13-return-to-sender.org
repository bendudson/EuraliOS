The traditional next step might be to implement a mass storage driver
to allow the OS to read and write to disk. Instead we're going to
work on bringing the network device up in the [[./14-network.org][next section]].

** Starting a driver

In the [[./14-network.org][next section]] we're going to work on a driver for a network
card, the [[https://wiki.osdev.org/RTL8139][RTL8139]]. We'll start this here by writing the code to
request information on PCI devices from the =pci= process.

Create a new crate:
#+begin_src shell
  cargo new rtl8139
#+end_src
then modify =Cargo.toml= (in the root and =rtl8139= directories), the
root =makefile=, add =build.rs= and a basic =rtl8139/src/main.rs= file
as done for =pci= in the [[./12-devices.org][last section]]. Compiling everything (=make run=) should
produce a =user/rtl8139= executable.
