* Network adapter

In [[./12-devices.org][section 12]] we wrote a basic =pci= program, which scans the
PCI bus for devices and makes it available to other processes.
Then in the [[./13-return-to-sender.org][last section]] we worked on enabling programs to open
connections, and ensuring that return messages go to the right
program. In this section we'll start adding device drivers,
starting with a network adapter.
