* Multiple users

Now that we have directories, we can combine them with the ability to
customise the Virtual File System (VFS) of programs to create a
multi-user system.

** Specifying a subprocess VFS

New processes are created with the =exec= syscall. The =param= argument
has not been used yet but was a placeholder for some way to specify
the virtual file system of the new process.

The default is that the new process shares a VFS with its parent. Any new mount
points added by one will be seen by the other. Another option is to start with
a copy of the parent VFS, removing or adding mount points to customise. Finally
we could start with an empty VFS and add paths to it.

To be consistent with other messages we could try using JSON format to specify
the VFS paths. That would mean adding a quite complex parser to the kernel, but
what we need to do is quite simple.
