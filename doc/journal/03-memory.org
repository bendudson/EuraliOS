* Memory management

  In the [[file:02-userspace.org][last section]] we worked out how to run a program in ring 3,
but couldn't protect programs from each other or run more than one
without having to manually choose memory ranges for each program.

To isolate programs from each other we need to set up separate
page tables for each process. We will want to keep the kernel
pages mapped, and add the user pages.
