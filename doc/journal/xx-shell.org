* Shell

Some possible ways to add a shell:
1. Port [[https://github.com/redox-os/ion][Ion]] from [[https://www.redox-os.org/][Redox-OS]].

2. Use an embedded scripting language with =no_std=
   implementation in Rust

   There are [[https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust#scripting][lists]] of [[https://github.com/alilleybrinker/langs-in-rust][languages in Rust]]

   - [[https://github.com/rune-rs/rune][Rune]]

3. Implement something simple to start with, with just the
   basic functionality needed
