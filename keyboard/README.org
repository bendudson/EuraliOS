* Keyboard driver program

This program runs in Ring 3 and needs IO permissions to read data from port 0x60.
It uses the =await_interrupt= EuraliOS syscall to wait for an interrupt to occur;
reads the scancode from port 0x60; passes the scancode to the [[https://docs.rs/pc-keyboard/latest/pc_keyboard/][pc_keyboard]] crate;
and then sends the corresponding character (if any) in a message to =STDOUT=.

The =init= program starts this keyboard driver, configuring it so that =keyboard='s
STDOUT is connected to the =init='s STDIN.
