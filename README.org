* EuraliOS

A hobby x86-64 operating system written in [[http://rust-lang.org][Rust]]. Named for Euralia in
A.A. Milne's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_on_a_Time][Once on a Time]] because I don't know who this is intended
for except, to borrow Milne's introduction, "For those, young or old,
who like the things which I like...  Either you will enjoy it, or you
won't. It is that sort of +book+ project."

*Disclaimer*: This was written by someone who doesn't (or didn't) know
anything about Rust or operating systems. The result is probably not
idiomatic Rust or a sensible OS design. If you are looking for a
usable operating system implemented in Rust then [[https://www.redox-os.org/][Redox OS]] is probably
what you want.

This started with [[https://os.phil-opp.com/][Philipp Oppermann's amazing blog]] on OS development
with Rust (second edition), and makes use of many of the crates that
Phil maintains (e.g. [[https://docs.rs/x86_64/latest/x86_64/][x86_64]] and [[https://docs.rs/bootloader/latest/bootloader/][bootloader]]). That blog has inspired
many other operating system siblings that I've found useful to study
including [[https://github.com/WartaPoirier-corp/ananos][ananos]], the [[https://github.com/sos-os/kernel][Stupid Operating System]], [[https://github.com/intermezzOS][intermezzOS]], and
especially [[https://github.com/vinc/moros][MOROS the Obscure Rust Operating System]]. The [[https://github.com/redox-os/kernel][Redox OS
kernel]] is very readable, and [[https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core][Xous]] has a similar focus on message
passing (This is a more comprehensive [[https://github.com/flosse/rust-os-comparison][comparison of Rust operating
systems]]).  Anything useful here was probably borrowed from one of
these projects; mistakes and omissions are my own.

** Features

There are many different directions to explore in building an OS, and
with EuraliOS I've focussed mainly on memory management and
pre-emptive multitasking so far. The result is an OS that can't do
much, but it can do it all at the same time.

- The "Merriwig" kernel
  - [X] Pre-emptive multitasking of user and kernel threads, with a round-robin scheduler
  - [X] Program memory isolation using paging
  - [X] On-demand memory allocation using page fault handler
  - [X] Stack and heap memory management
  - [X] Frame allocator based on a bitmap tree structure
  - [X] ELF loader using the [[https://crates.io/crates/object][object crate]]
  - [X] Rendezvous message passing for all inter-process communication.
        Messages can contain communication handles or transfer ownership of memory regions
        between processes and threads.
  - [X] 18 syscalls for memory and process/thread control and inter-process communication
  - [X] A [[https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html][vDSO]]-like fast mechanism for access to timing information from user programs
  - [X] Virtual file systems that can be shared between processes or per-process
        as a mechanism for capability-based security and user isolation

- Drivers as userspace programs (Ring 3)
  - [X] Keyboard driver using the [[https://docs.rs/pc-keyboard/latest/pc_keyboard/][pc-keyboard]] crate
  - [X] Virtual consoles and VGA text output using the [[https://crates.io/crates/vga][vga crate]]
  - [X] RTL8139 network card driver
  - [X] TCP network stack using [[https://docs.rs/smoltcp/latest/smoltcp/][smoltcp]] in user space, with DHCP and DNS

- User programs
  - [X] Login process and multiple users
  - [X] A basic shell
  - [X] A simple [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)][Gopher]] browser
  - [X] A RAM disk for temporary files
  - [ ] Port of the [[https://github.com/ilai-deutel/kibi][Kibi text editor]]
  - [ ] Virtio 9P to access host filesystems

There is no disk driver yet, so user programs are compiled and then
the ELF files are included in the =init= binary using Rust's
[[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_bytes.html][include_bytes]] macro (another idea taken from [[https://github.com/vinc/moros][MOROS]]).

** Building and running

Euralios depends on the [[https://github.com/rust-osdev/vga][vga]] crate, with some modifications in [[https://github.com/bendudson/vga/tree/euralios][a branch
here]] as a git submodule.  Either clone with submodules (with e.g the
=--recurse-submodules= option) or run:
#+begin_src bash
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
#+end_src

After setting up Rust, Cargo and QEMU (see [[https://os.phil-opp.com/minimal-rust-kernel/][phil-opp blog]]), running
#+begin_src bash
  $ make run
#+end_src
should download dependencies, build everything, and launch qemu.

*Notes*

1. You'll probably need to use the Rust nightly build. EuraliOS was
   originally developed using Rustc =1.61-nightly (6a7055661 2022-02-27)= and
   is known to work with =1.79.0-nightly (7f2fc33da 2024-04-22)=.
2. Rust needs to build =core= and =compiler_builtins= libraries for
   the =x86_64-euralios= target. To do that cargo needs the rust source code,
   which can be installed by running =rustup component add rust-src=.

** Documentation

I've tried to document the steps to build EuraliOS, starting from the
end of [[https://os.phil-opp.com/heap-allocation/][post 10 (heap allocation)]] of Phil Opp's blog (2nd Ed). At that
point the kernel had a heap and a bump frame allocator (so could
allocate but not free memory), some code to handle pages,
exceptions, and VGA output. [[https://os.phil-opp.com/async-await/][Post 11]] went on to add Async/Await
cooperative multitasking, but here we go in a slightly different
direction...

- [[file:doc/journal/01-interrupts-processes.org][1. Interrupts and processes]] in which kernel multi-threading is
  introduced by modifying the timer interrupt handler to capture and
  change the context (registers etc).
- [[file:doc/journal/02-userspace.org][2. Userspace]] in which a program is loaded into memory and run in
  Ring 3 (user space). Syscall/sysret is used to implement a simple
  way to print from user programs.
- [[file:doc/journal/03-memory.org][3. Memory management]] in which we create separate page tables for
  user processes and stacks for each thread.
- [[file:doc/journal/04-more-syscalls.org][4. Syscalls for thread control]] which adds syscalls to spawn new
  threads and to exit from a thread. We also learn how to use the
  [[https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/swapgs][swapgs]] and [[https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/wrmsr][wrmsr]] instructions to switch stacks inside syscalls.
- [[file:doc/journal/05-memory-returns.org][5. Memory returns]] which implements a better frame allocator that
  can keep track of available frames, so that memory can be freed when
  threads and processes exit.
- [[file:doc/journal/06-user-memory.org][6. User space memory management]] in which we create a heap for each
  user process so that user programs can use =Box=, =Vec= etc, using a
  linked list allocator. As a bonus this allows a threading API with
  closures as in the Rust stdlib. We also re-organise the repository
  into a Cargo Workspace, with separate crates for the kernel and user
  program.
- [[file:doc/journal/07-ipc.org][7. Inter-process communication (IPC)]] where a simple "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_(Plan_9)][rendezvous]]"
  communication method is implemented, enabling a user program to
  get input from the keyboard.
- [[file:doc/journal/08-faster-ipc.org][8. Faster IPC]] in which we switch tasks in syscalls and keyboard
  interrupt handler, to minimise delays in the communication.
- [[file:doc/journal/09-message-sending.org][9. Sending messages]] which adds the =send= syscall, allowing the user
  program to send messages to a VGA output kernel thread.
- [[file:doc/journal/10-stdlib.org][10. A standard library]] in which we start a =euralios_std= "standard"
  library, moving code out of the user program into a separate crate.
- [[file:doc/journal/11-messages.org][11. More messages]]
- [[file:doc/journal/12-devices.org][12. PCI devices]] where we start working on input/output to PCI
  devices and discovering which devices are available.
- [[file:doc/journal/13-return-to-sender.org][13. Return to sender]] where we add the =send_receive= syscall to make
  remote procedure calls more reliable, and start to develop a Virtual
  File System (VFS) with a new =open= syscall.
- [[file:doc/journal/14-network.org][14. RTL8139 network card]] where we develop a basic driver for the
  [[https://wiki.osdev.org/RTL8139][RTL8139]] card, adapting [[https://github.com/vinc/moros/blob/trunk/src/sys/net/rtl8139.rs][the MOROS driver]]. In the process we wrap the
  =send_receive= system call into an =rcall= remote procedure call,
  and add frame allocation of consecutive physical frames for direct
  memory access.
- [[file:doc/journal/15-messages.org][15. Message error handling]] where we add error handling and send retries to
  make messaging more robust. We also add a =thread_yield= system call
  to yield control of the processor when waiting and recovering from errors.
- [[file:doc/journal/16-arp.org][16. Address Resolution Protocol]] implementation: Writing a simple program
  to send and receive an ARP packet through the network.
- [[file:doc/journal/17-tcp-stack.org][17. TCP stack]] where the [[https://docs.rs/smoltcp/latest/smoltcp/][smoltcp]] crate is used to provide a TCP stack
  in user-space which communicates with the network card driver by
  messaging.
- [[file:doc/journal/18-gopher.org][18. Gopher]]: Developing a simple Gopher protocol browser, and in the
  process improving the Virtual File System (VFS) to handle more
  complicated OPEN messages, and the TCP program to READ and WRITE
  sockets.
- [[./doc/journal/19-timing.org][19. Timing]]: Adding functions to get time since system start. To
  speed up access to timer calibration data we map a page read-only
  into every user program, as the [[https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html][Linux virtual dynamic shared object
  (vDSO)]] does.
- [[./doc/journal/20-dns.org][20. Domain Name System (DNS)]], adding the ability to look up IP addresses
  from host names.
- [[./doc/journal/21-vga.org][21. VGA driver and terminals]] in user space, using the [[https://crates.io/crates/vga][vga
  crate]]. Allows separate consoles for system programs and user
  programs like the Gopher browser.
- [[./doc/journal/22-ramdisk.org][22. RAMdisk driver]] to store files and develop the filesystem API,
  starting a basic interactive shell able to list files and run
  programs.
- [[./doc/journal/23-keyboard.org][23. Interrupts and a better keyboard]]: Enabling user programs to receive
  hardware interrupts, and moving the keyboard driver out of the kernel
  into a user-space driver.
- [[./doc/journal/24-text-editor.org][24. Text editor]]. Porting the [[https://github.com/ilai-deutel/kibi][Kibi]] text editor to run on EuraliOS.
- [[./doc/journal/25-directories.org][25. Directories]] to hierarchically organise files
- [[./doc/journal/26-multiple-users.org][26. Multiple users]] and login process, using separate virtual file systems
  to control user capabilities
- [[./doc/journal/27-servers.org][27. Servers]], generalising the RAMdisk server code
